<p></p>
<p>getLife is a support system for people who are going through physical injury or have a history of physical injury. It is an ecosystem consisting of technology and people, to serve the people with injury. To motivate and rehabilitate themselves through their difficult times towards their overall physical, mental and social well being, within the comfortable and private space of their home. </p>

<p>In this ecosystem, with the help of human coach/physiotherapist, AI Coach and computer vision, trainees will train machine learning algorithms to align their particular injuries with most appropriate workout routines and then with help of their AI Coach they will rehabilitate themselves at their own pace, comparing themselves with their own former condition. And, parallelly being matched with other trainees in the getLife community, to motivate and support each other through their adversity. </p>
