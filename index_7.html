<h1>getLife : Thesis Book </h1>

<p>I have started my secondary research with trying to define wellness (physical, mental and social) followed by going through currently available solution. Then empathised on which target groups of people needs the help most. As technogym being current provider of a physical fitness services, I set the goal to provide a solution that is to be built on top of physical fitness as a foundation. So, the target group becomes the people who are dealing with physical unfitness and physical injuries (to stretch the solution to be more core needs of people). 
    So, in the primary research phase I conducted interview with parcipants with diverse ethnicities, gender, physical activity levels and age in their 20s and constructed my concrete design challange, which is how to rehabilitate and motivate people to their overall wellnes (physically, mentally and socially).
    As I was going though the ideation phase, I explored through many technological interventions in physical fitness and computer vision deemed the most fit for my design challenge as a tool, as, for the people who are going through their own experiences with injuries which is affecting them physically, mentally and socially, computer vision as tool might give them a private space to work on and push through their difficult times. So, Through I explored through Kinect, webcam as hardware and human pose estimation codes from Github and other softwares available to communicate the fuctionality and made other auxiliary mockups like mobile and PC application interfaces to give the control to physiotherapists/coach and the trainees. And end of making the whole blueprint of the solution ecosystem I focused mostly on the Physical aspect of the system and computer vision solution. 
    In future I am willing to develop it more with Infrared Heatmapping and Equipment tracking for tracking for technogym, to generate and aquire more relevant data and more sophisticated data visualisation.
